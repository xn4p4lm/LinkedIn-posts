As a transwoman living in Florida, the proposed Florida Anti-Trans Bill CS/HB1421 terrifies me. It also makes me even more apprehensive about the future of trans care in America. This legislation will not only restrict access to vital gender-affirming healthcare for both Minors and Adults. It will also embolden the current environment of discrimination and marginalization for the entire trans community.

Here are some key points from this legislation:

- Prohibits health insurance policies and health maintenance contracts from providing coverage for gender clinical interventions.

- Requires physicians providing gender clinical interventions to maintain professional liability coverage and obtain informed written consent from adult patients during every visit.

- Prevents changes to a person's biological sex on a birth certificate except for scrivener's errors or cases where the sex characteristics were ambiguous at birth.

- Authorizes courts in Florida to intervene in child custody cases to protect children from gender clinical interventions in another state.

The ramifications of this bill are far-reaching and detrimental, affecting the mental and physical health, career aspirations, and social interactions of trans individuals. Now, more than ever, we need to demand, acknowledge, and respect the rights of every person, regardless of gender identity. As with other anti-trans legislation, this will have far-reaching and detrimental effects on cisgender individuals as well. 

Now more than ever, it is crucial for allies, corporations, and organizations to stand with the trans community and advocate for our rights. We must promote inclusive policies in our workplaces and schools, ensuring that trans individuals have access to safe spaces, gender-affirming care, and equal opportunities to succeed.

To allies, I urge you to use your voices to support and uplift the trans community. Educate yourself on trans rights and issues, and engage in meaningful conversations with friends, family, and colleagues. Your advocacy can make a difference in changing hearts and minds.
