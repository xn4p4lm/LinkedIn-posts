Hey, y'all! Quick update (TLDR): I'm now living it up in Seattle, WA, having left Florida due to the recent laws that've been rough on our trans and queer communities. If you're around, let's definitely meet up!

In my last post, I shared about the tough stuff going on in Florida. It got so much that after 30+ years, I decided to say goodbye to the south and hello to the Pacific Northwest.

Now I'm in Seattle, WA, and I gotta say, I'm loving the vibes here. I've been here a few weeks, and it already feels like home.

I'm totally open to hanging out with connections in the area and would love to hear any suggestions for events, networking opportunities, and cool places to check out.

Looking ahead, I'm pumped about exploring this new part of my life, and can't wait to check out places like Vancouver and Portland once I'm more settled in.

So, if you're in the Seattle area or know of any places or events I should be a part of, hit me up!
