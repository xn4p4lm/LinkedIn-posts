TLDR: Live in Seattle, WA now! Please reach out if you wanna connect in person!

Update from my last post regarding the incredulous laws that are now impacting Florida and it's trans and queer communities. 

Because these laws were making it increasingly hard for me to feel safe and secure in the southeast. Iâ€™ve finally left the south after 30+ years of calling it home.

As such I've now moved to the Pacific Northwest, specifically Seattle, WA. I've been here now for a few weeks and am so far loving it.

I welcome the opportunity to connect and meetup with connections here in the area. As well as welcoming suggestions for events, networking opportunities, as well as places I should check out. 

I am looking forward to discovering this new chapter of my life, as well as eventually visiting Vancouver and Portland once I'm settled in more.
