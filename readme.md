# LinkedIn Posts using ChatGPT-4

This repo is a collection of my attemps at using [ChatGPT-4](https://chat.openai.com/chat?model=gpt-4) to help me write LinkedIn posts on complicated topics. 

I mostly use ChatGPT for the framework and outline, and then we write / modify it to suit my voice better. 

I've been using this for a while, and I've found it to be a great way to get started on a LinkedIn post, especially when I'm not sure where to start. 

##### Note: Tools like ChatGPT-4 are helpful for people like me who are Neurodivergent ( Combine type ADHD and (Possibly Autism - High scores on raads-r but not officially diagnosed)) and help me put into words in a cognizant and concice way
