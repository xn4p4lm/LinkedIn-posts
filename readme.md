# LinkedIn Posts using ChatGPT-4

#### *Note*: Tools like ChatGPT-4 are helpful for people like me who are Neurodivergent* and help me put into words in a cognizant and concice way

---

This repo is a collection of my attemps at using [ChatGPT-4](https://chat.openai.com/chat?model=gpt-4) to help me write LinkedIn posts.

I mostly use ChatGPT in a few ways: 

-  To help biuld a framework and outline on complicated topics, and then we write / modify it to suit my voice better
- To rewrite my post into a proper post instead of a stream of conciousness style of post

I've been using this for a while, and I've found it to be a great way to get started on a LinkedIn post, especially when I'm not sure where to start. 

Regarding the * in this case Nurodivergence for me is: 
- Combine type ADHD
- Possibly Autism - High scores on raads-r but not officially diagnosed yet (Working on getting properly tested)
